JBoss BPM Suite 6
=========

This is the central repository for JBoss BPM Suite 6 demo and labs.
The repo contains several modules and sub-modules. The Demo itself consists of two modules, the **bpmdemo** which contains the self-provisioning process, the datamodel and the Rules required to execute the process, and the **provisioning** which is the Web Application that simulates interaction from a JEE app external to the business-central.
Then there are other modules like **datamodel** and **handsonlab**. The first is a simple example of a centralized model of objects to be used in other projects, the second is a library of exercises to explain several way of adopting the technology. **handsonlab** contains several submodules each of which is a small project dedicated to show the BRMS/BPMS APIs.
